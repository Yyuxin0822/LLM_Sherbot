# LLM_Sherbot

As of Oct 28 2023, the raw code of Sherbot is temporarily offline. Please contact yuxiny0822@gmail.com if you are interested.

Sherbot is an LLM-based web application for generative flow diagrams. As an educational tool for environmental engineering, it generates flow / circular economy diagram and allows freedom for users to doodle and modify.

This realease realizes all the below functions of Sherbot. The interactivity of the web will be improved in the next release
### Init
1. Activate virtual environment and python dependencies
2. cd "static", install node modules in package-lock, this project uses leader-line and plain-draggable package by anseki
3. The webapp is powered by gpt-4 and dalle2, you can adapt the code to the model you selected accordingly
4. Run python app.py, the webpage will open

### GENERATE FLOW
1. "GENERATE FLOW" is the button to send new TEXT-TO-FLOW DIAGRAM request.
2. First, Input your environmental description here, click "GENERATE FLOW"

2. Then, click "ASK SHERBOT"
3. The tool will expand on the internal process for generating flow
   This process can be revisited by click "Explore > Lookup Complex Flow"

4. Now, go back to by clicking "Explore > Lookup Simple Flow"

##### Trial 3
1. Try, right-click on multiple element and multiple flow, like below

2. Then, click "ASK SHERBOT"
3. It will generate a complex flow view, delinating multiple processes for going from input to output

5. Now, go back to by clicking "Explore > Lookup Simple Flow"

##### Trial 4
1. Select all element and flow

2. Then, click "ASK SHERBOT"
3. Then, click "Explore > Lookup Complex Flow"

![text-to-flow](__Pic__/11.png)

4. Then, click "Explore > Element Co-optimization"
